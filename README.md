For this project, I developed a contact management application in C++ that allows users to add, delete, and search for contacts. The goal was to create an easy-to-use interface for managing contact information for a small business or personal use. It addresses the issue of manually tracking contact details in physical records or inefficient digital tools.
I feel that the user interface is one of the most polished aspects of this project. I carefully designed the menu system to be intuitive and implemented clear prompts and feedback for the user. Additionally, I ensured proper error handling when adding or searching contacts, preventing program crashes.
One area for improvement is file handling. Right now, the contacts are saved to a text file, but there’s no check to ensure the file is properly opened before writing to it. I would also implement data encryption for saving sensitive contact information securely. These changes would improve the program's reliability and security, especially if it were used in a business setting.
The most challenging part was implementing dynamic memory allocation to handle the contacts list. Initially, I struggled with memory leaks when adding or deleting contacts, but after reviewing C++ memory management techniques and using tools like Valgrind to check for leaks, I was able to correct the issue.
This project greatly improved my ability to work with C++ data structures, particularly arrays and dynamic memory. I also strengthened my problem-solving skills when debugging and refactoring the code. These skills will definitely help me in future coursework, especially in courses that involve data management and algorithms.
To make this program maintainable, I focused on modularizing the code into functions for each major operation (e.g., adding a contact, searching, etc.). I also added comments to explain complex sections of the code. This would make it easier for someone else (or myself in the future) to maintain the program or add new features, such as importing contacts from a CSV file.”
